    <h2>About Vans Fashion</h2>
    <p>
      Founded in 1966, Vans has been more than just a brand—it’s a lifestyle. Rooted in Southern California’s skate culture, Vans has become a global icon in streetwear and urban fashion. Our signature sneakers, like the Old Skool and Slip-On, have transcended skateparks to become staples in wardrobes worldwide, celebrated for their minimalist design and endless versatility.

    <p>
      At Vans, we believe fashion is about self-expression. Our clothing and footwear are designed to empower creativity, whether you’re pairing our checkered sneakers with a bold graphic tee or layering a Vans hoodie with distressed denim for that perfect streetwear look. We draw inspiration from music, art, and youth culture, blending comfort with a rebellious edge that resonates with skaters, artists, and trendsetters alike.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sustainability is also at the heart of our fashion ethos. We’re committed to using eco-friendly materials and ethical production practices, ensuring that our collections not only look good but also do good. From collaborating with artists to launching limited-edition drops, Vans continues to push the boundaries of street fashion while staying true to our “Off the Wall” spirit.
